     * Useful when paginating results. Returns a maximum of <code>end - start</code> instances. <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are not primary keys, they are indexes in the result set. Thus, <code>0</code> refers to the first result in the set. Setting both <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> to {@link com.liferay.portal.kernel.dao.orm.QueryUtil#ALL_POS} will return the full result set. If <code>orderByComparator</code> is specified, then the query will include the given ORDER BY logic. If <code>orderByComparator</code> is absent and pagination is required (<code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are not {@link com.liferay.portal.kernel.dao.orm.QueryUtil#ALL_POS}), then the query will include the default ORDER BY logic from {@link com.jcampoy.liferay.samples.model.impl.FooModelImpl}. If both <code>orderByComparator</code> and pagination are absent, for performance reasons, the query will not have an ORDER BY clause and the returned result set will be sorted on by the primary key in an ascending order.
